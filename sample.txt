This is an example of what a program/recipe written in COOK looks like!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for opening my cookbook! Today, we'll be making a simple balsamic glaze. This recipe makes a little over cups of glaze.
You need to first measure a proper size of pot to use for the boiling. Make sure it is large enough!

Next, we'll go over ingredients (there aren't too many!)
Measure 20 cups of balsamic-vinegar.
Measure 5 cups of brown-sugar!
Finally, measure about 1 cup of honey as well.

Turn on low heat, and in the pot mix the balsamic-vinegar and the brown-sugar well.
Stirring in the pot slowly, pour the honey into the pot too and mix.
Before you move on to the next step, make sure everything has completely dissolved!

Bring your stove to a simmer for a reduction until the brown-sugar is gone:
Boil in the brown-sugar and reduce the brown-sugar by the 1 cup each minute.

In the pot, reduce everything in the pot by the 5 cups of brown-sugar.

When it's finally done, serve or store your glaze right from the pot so that it stays fresh. Enjoy!
