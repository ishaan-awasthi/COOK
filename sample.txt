Thanks for opening my cookbook! Today, we'll be making a simple balsamic glaze. This recipe makes about 5 cups of glaze.
First, measure a proper size of pot to use for the boiling. Make sure it is large enough!

Next, we'll go over ingredients (there aren't too many!)
Measure 4 cups of balsamic-vinegar and set it aside.
Measure 1 cup of brown-sugar and keep it next to the vinegar.
Finally, measure about 1 cup of honey as well.

Turn on low heat and in the pot mix the balsamic-vinegar and the brown-sugar well.
Stirring in the pot slowly, pour the honey into the pot too and mix.
Before you move on to the next step, make sure everything has completely dissolved!

When you're ready, turn the flame on high. You'll need to reduce in the pot until the pot has the brown-sugar gone.
It's a long process, this can even take up to 30 minutes!

When it's finally done serve or store your glaze right from the pot so that it stays fresh!
